need a simple design system/language to capture the essence of markdown.  the concept is that each line is really a node in an ordered collection of nodes therefor these nodes can be manipulated and customized.  also it needs to have customizable commands so that the client can tailor the language to thereselves. 

ui should ultimately include the ability to insert cards that are linked to other notes/nodes and can be displayed in a small window.

edit
every character is a node and nodes can be grouped together in containers.
