file naming is a freaking pain in the ass.  i feel as far as the user experience (at least for me, i can be a little anal :smile:) it is a horrible concept.  

consider this scenario your in vscode and you have a folder called braindump in fact the very folder this note is being written in lol (very meta) so you open a note and you name it note.  but then you want another document and you insticatively reach to call it note.  but alas you can not so naturally you name it note1. 

the thing is i dont really give a fuck what the file is called i just want to open a note.  but this applies to everything saving files from the web saving notes etc it is currently such a fragmented and annoying process that is holding the web and computer software as a whole back.

instead everything should be a node that is given a uuid. the title or traditional file name is just a property of this node that the ui can display as desired 

this way you just create a file and it stores it under its uuid not your 
attempt at a meaningfull file organization system that is ultimately not successful at matching the way that you consume information.

i know what you are thinking there is this or that to solve that problem and you would be correct, the best tool for the job after all.  brookem is these solutions are fragmented, costly, inconsistent, etc the list goes on and on.  

i think it is time to create more open api to the web allowing the client to truly customize the information to match their consumption mehtod and workflow
