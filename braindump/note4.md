psudeocode for commit process 

```
    @Commit(

    )
```

# abstract
it should be able to return a commit id this would be saved as a node of course (seeing a theme here) and should be able to accept as many customization parameters as need for the client

## example use case
you start a git repository that represents a project just a blank directory named accordingly.  you have only a seed at this point.  so you write a seed document. then you either depending on your style will make a flowchart or a outline or something of this nature.  so you are essentially in seed mode (at least in my paradigm/design system) so i considered making a seed branch then i would go into psudeocode mode.  so rather than making branches i should be able to add custom markup layers to use.
