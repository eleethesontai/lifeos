coding time partitions should be broken into blocks of time of at least each of the following,

training,
research,
braindump
outline
psuedocode,
seed

some of these are more stages than categories.  the categories should be blocks that are scheduled each day for segments of the day.

so coding time, training, research, braindump this are all repeating cycles of acivities that are need for any project in any domain really.  possibly more to follow of course, frequency and cycle of each will depend on both the project and the team/developer building it.
